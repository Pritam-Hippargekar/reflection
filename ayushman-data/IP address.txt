Class A with a /8 subnet mask
Class B with a /16 subnet mask
Class C with a /24 subnet mask

IP Addresses have 2 components: 
=====================================
A) Network Address 
B) Host Address


The subnet mask is made up of setting up all network bits to all ones and host bits to all zeros.
Subnet Mask 192.168.0.0/24 will equate to IP Range 192.168.0.0 ‚Äî 192.168.0.255.

CIDR Block Notation: 
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/N  (where N is the number of bits used for the subnet mask.)

we made 24 bits to ones and the remaining 8 bits to zeros because the Subnet Mask end range is 24.
