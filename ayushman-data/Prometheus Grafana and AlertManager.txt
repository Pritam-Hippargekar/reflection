There are 4 components in the above architecture:
---------------------------------------------
1) A microservice developed using using spring boot, actuator, micrometer etc to expose metrics as an endpoint like /prometheus.
   - Adding Micrometer Prometheus Registry to your Spring Boot application
2) Prometheus service with configurations necessary to scrape the /prometheus endpoint and integrate with AlertManager.
   - A data scraper that pulls metrics data over HTTP periodically at a configured interval.
   - A time-series database to store all the metrics data.
   - A simple user interface where you can visualize, query, and monitor all the metrics.
3) Grafana service which will be pulling data from Prometheus and use it for data visualizations.
4) AlertManager service which will be purely used for alerting based on alert rules defined in Prometheus.
