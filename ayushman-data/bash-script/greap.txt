1) Display the Number of Lines Before or After the Search String....
Another couple of options are the –A and –B switches, which display the matched line and number of lines either that come before or after the search string.
While the man page gives a more detailed explanation, I find it easiest to remember the options as –A = after, and –B = before:

SYntax: grep [OPTIONS] pattern [FILE(S)]
# ifconfig | grep -A 4 inet
# ifconfig | grep -B 2 UP


2) Exclude Files while using grep
You can use the --exclude option to exclude directories, specific files or files with specific extensions.
$ grep -r string --exclude=filename --exclude=*.png --exclude=folder/* folder-name

3) Include Files while using grep
You can use the --include option to include only the specific directories, specific files or files with specific extensions.
$ grep -r string --include=filename --include=*.php --include=folder/* folder-name
